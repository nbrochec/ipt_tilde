# ipt_tilde

ipt~ is a Max/MSP external object for real-time classification of instrumental playing techniques.

This object loads and runs TorchScript (`.ts`) classification models, enabling low latency inference on CPU and MPS devices.

This project is related to [nime2025](https://github.com/nbrochec/nime2025) repository, where you can find the code used in our paper *Introducing EG-IPT and ipt~: a novel electric guitar dataset and a new Max/MSP object for real-time classification of instrumental playing techniques* presented during [NIME 2025](http://nime2025.org/), and train a classification model for electric guitar playing techniques.

👉 Train your own playing techniques recognition model in following instructions from our [ipt_recognition](http://github.com/nbrochec/ipt_recognition) repository.

### ⚙️ Requirements

+ macOS 10.13 or later
+ Apple Silicon processor M1 or later (Note: this external doesn't work on Intel processors at the moment)
+ Max 8.6 or later / Max 9.0.3 or later

### 💾 Installation

+ Go to [Releases](https://github.com/nbrochec/ipt_tilde/releases) and download the latest version of ipt~ (`ipt_tilde.dmg`)
+ Copy the extracted `ipt_tilde` folder into the Packages folder in your Max folder (by default, this is `~/Documents/Max 9/Packages`)
+ You're done!
 
### 🎥 Demo Video
A demonstration video of ipt~ detecting in real-time Instrumental Playing Techniques from the EG-IPT dataset is available [here](https://youtu.be/PFiWNnOd-vg).

## 💻 Build Instructions

- In a terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nbrochec/ipt_tilde.git --recurse-submodules
cd ipt_tilde
cmake -S . -B build DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target ipt_tilde -j 8 --verbose
```

**Note:** The instructions above may trigger a CMake warning:  `static library kineto_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND not found.`  However, this does not appear to affect compilation or functionality.  Using the pre-compiled binaries from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) will avoid this warning, but as of version 2.4.1, their CPU performance is approximately 20x slower compared to the Anaconda-provided binaries.

- Copy the produced `.mxo` external inside `~/Documents/Max 9/Packages/ipt_tilde/externals/`

# ipt_tilde

ipt~ is a Max/MSP external object for real-time classification of instrumental playing techniques.

This object loads and runs TorchScript (`.ts`) classification models, enabling low latency inference on CPU and MPS devices.

This project is related to [nime2025](https://github.com/nbrochec/nime2025) repository. Where you can find the code used in our paper *Introducing EG-IPT and ipt~: a novel electric guitar dataset and a new Max/MSP object for real-time classification of instrumental playing techniques* presented during [NIME 2025](http://nime2025.org/).

## ðŸ’» Build Instructions
<!-- (TODO: Formalize later) -->

(MacOS / ARM only, for now)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:nbrochec/ipt_tilde.git --recurse-submodules
cd ipt_tilde
cmake -S . -B build DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target ipt_tilde -j 8 --verbose
```

Note: above instructions will result in a CMake warning: `static library kineto_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND not found.`. AFAICT, this doesn't seem to be a problem, compilation works regardless. Using the pre-compiled binaries directly from [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) will avoid said warnings, but as of version 2.4.1, the performance is 20x worse on CPU than the Anaconda ones.
